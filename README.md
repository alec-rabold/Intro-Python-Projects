# Python-Projects
<hr>
<b>What is this respository? </b>
<p> These are a handful of the introductory mini-assignments I programmed to familiarize myself with Python. </p>
<p> Yes, they are pretty basic. My goal here wasn't to dive into complex Python software quite yet, but rather to learn a bit more about its syntax as well as its pros/cons over other progamming languages. </p>

<b> What's next? </b>
<p> My short-term goal is to keep reading up on Python a little bit more each day. Being someone who loves to learn, as long as I go to bed at night knowing more than I did the previous, there's not much more I can ask for. </p>
<p> That being said, I understand that this language is HUGE with artificial intelligence - most notably with <b>Keras</b>, <b>Theano</b>, and <b>TensorFlow</b>. I'm super interested in deep learning algorithms, so brushing up my Python (and Linear Algebra) will absolutely prepare me to be successful in those projects down the road. </p>
